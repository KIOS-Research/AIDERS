uint32 missionID    # The Mission ID. Use to distinguishã€€different mission
uint16 missTotalLen # The Mission waypoint total length, could not exceed 65535
uint8 repeatTimes   # Mission execution can be repeated more than once. A value of 0 means the mission
                    # only executes once, and does not repeat. A value of 1 means the mission will

uint8 finishedAction # Action the aircraft will take when the waypoint mission is complete.

# While the aircraft is travelling between waypoints, you can offset its speed by
# using the throttle joystick  on the remote controller. `maxFlightSpeed` is this
# offset when the joystick is pushed  to maximum deflection. For example, If
# maxFlightSpeed is 10 m/s, then pushing the throttle joystick all the  way up
# will add 10 m/s to the aircraft speed, while pushing down will subtract 10 m/s
# from the aircraft  speed. If the remote controller stick is not at maximum
# deflection, then the offset speed will be  interpolated between [0,
# `maxFlightSpeed`] with a resolution of 1000 steps. If the  offset speed is
# negative, then the aircraft will fly backwards to previous waypoints. When it
# reaches the  first waypoint, it will then hover in place until a positive speed
# is  applied. `maxFlightSpeed` has a range of [2,15] m/s.
# unit: m/s
float32 maxFlightSpeed

# The base automatic speed of the aircraft as it moves between waypoints with
# range [-15, 15] m/s. The  aircraft's actual speed is a combination of the base
# automatic speed, and the speed control given by  the throttle joystick on the
# remote controller. If `autoFlightSpeed` >0: Actual  speed is `autoFlightSpeed` +
# Joystick Speed (with combined max  of `maxFlightSpeed`) If `autoFlightSpeed` =0:
# Actual speed is  controlled only by the remote controller joystick. If
# `autoFlightSpeed` <0 and the  aircraft is at the first waypoint, the aircraft
# will hover in place until the speed is made positive by  the remote controller
# joystick.
